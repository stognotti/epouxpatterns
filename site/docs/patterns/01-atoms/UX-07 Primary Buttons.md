### Pattern Usage
A primary button is always the first option to place a button. 

There might be several primary buttons if there is also at least a secondary button. 

Whether an action is a primary or secondary one as well as how many buttons might be added needs to be decided according to UX principles. Inform and ask the UX team for each application.
