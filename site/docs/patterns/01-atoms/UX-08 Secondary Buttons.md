### Pattern Usage
A secondary button can be used when there is at least one primary button in the same screen or step. 

There might be several secondary buttons depending on the available actions. 

Whether an action is a primary or secondary one as well as how many buttons might be added needs to be decided according to UX principles. Inform and ask the UX team for each application.
